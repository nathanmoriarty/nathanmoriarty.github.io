	<p><b>Short Bio</b></p>
  <p>After studying Mathematics BSc at UCL 2010-13, I joined Fidessa - a financial services software company. I went on to complete an engineer training program at National Grid - GB System Operator - alongside a sponsored foundation degree in Electrical Power Engineering at Aston University. After a further year of experience at UKPN - Distribution Network Operator - within the innovation team, I'm now enrolled at the LoLo CDT in Energy Demand Studies.</p>

  <p><b>So What Now?</b></p>
  <p>I am hoping to optimise system integration of electrified transport and heating through predictive analytics and demand side response strategies over the PhD.</p>
