Heat Pumps, on the road to mainstream ?

Heat pumps could be our only hope of low carbon heat. There are only a couple of options to achieve this:

Option A: calls on energy giants to decarbonise gas, however:

1.	Very strong price signals are needed to transition from natural gas
2.	Expertise is required from established companies who profit from status quo.

Option B: calls upon us, as prosumers, to install heat pumps, however:

1.	They are currently more expensive than conventional boilers due to installation
2.	Households must be insulated to a high standard, have underfloor heating, and solar panels prior to thinking about one.

But are we ready? Is there a catch ? and what exactly is a heat pump ?

In a recent survey Ipsos Mori found that 68% of householders had not heard of a heatpump [Ipsos Mori 2013].

The technical details

Heat pumps tap into natural thermal inertia from the surrounding environment and ‘pump’ warmth into the house. 

This thermodynamic effect is a bit like a seesaw – you lean on one side and the other rises. This is measured with a factor called a COP – coefficient of performance:

COPheating = Tinside / (Tinside – Toutside)

This factor is the exciting part. Considering graph 1. At even as low as -10 (Deg C) outside
you could have a COP of 20. This means 20 times more heat energy than you pay for in electrical energy ! 

 

Realistically a COP between 3-5 is achievable however that’s still 5 times more bang for buck. 

So where’s the catch ?

With a heat pump what we are looking at fundamentally a fridge in reverse. Consider a freezer, the metallic element at the back is dissipating heat from the inside to the outside.

Therein lies the issue, you have a big fridge strapped to the outside of your house. This unit must be on the exterior of the property for air exchange.

In addition to aesthetics there are also a lot of other issues to be dealt with before they hit mainstream.

So where are the quick wins ?

A recent report prepared by Element Energy for the committee on climate change identified four categorical barriers, besides cost:

•	performance;
•	awareness and consumer acceptance;
•	planning and noise;
•	suitability; and


Barrier	Areas of improvement
performance	Incorrectly sized heat pumps
ASHPs not achieving minimum SPF to be considered renewable under EU Renewable Energy Sources Directive
awareness	Awareness remains low among domestic consumers. 
Technician during heating repair is point of contact for customers
Only breakdown of the existing system triggers investment
Confidence from industry over continued uptake/policy support is low therefore absence of heat pump installation reskilling
noise	Elongated planning processes for commercial-scale GSHPs 
Noise from ASHP an issue, particularly in densely populated urban areas.
suitability	Poor insulation (they work best in insulated properties)
Space constraints for ASHP
Sufficient land for GSHPs 
Associated refurbishment costs associated with the installation of new emitters (radiators/underfloor heating


Cost saving innovation ?

Up to 50% of the upfront cost of heat pump systems is the installation cost. The technology is fairly mature as draws upon principles from a developed HVAC/Refridgeration market. The real costs and issue lie in installation. Where to put it, how big which choices.

For a cost saving innovation I propose a standard method where appropriate to develop the installation for mass market. An ikea style innovation is ripe for the installation of this equipment.

So what now ?

There are around 20k heat pump installations a year. When this is compared to the 1.6 million gas boilers each year [DECC 2014], there is an uphill struggle. Considering that most consumers (>70%) replace their heating system at end of life, [Ipsos Mori 2013] there is a sense of urgency to address the engineering and economic challenges sooner rather than later to reduce CO2 reduction. 

What can we do ?

Due to the sizeable work required it is thought sometimes best to install the heat pump whilst other major building works are underway [Energy Suprises]. It may be strategically advantageous to delay building works if your heating system is due an upgrade.
